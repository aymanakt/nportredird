18 Mar 2001 -- 0.6
---------------------
Fixes:
 - The issue with unclaimed threads has been dealt with. It appears to be
   fixed. This is actually the highlight of this release.

Additions:
 - A new, rather unusual feature whereby the destination of a redirection can
   be specified as "/dev/null" has been added. It is useful for debuging or 
   situations where the destination host is unspecified but you still want 
   the incoming connections to continue to flow in uninterrupted.
 - Robustness-oriented fixes have been applied throughout, especially in the
   areas of I/O.
 - Minor clean-ups.
    


27 Oct 2000 -- 0.5
---------------------
Fixes:
 - Minor clean ups.

Additions:
 - Config file features new keywords (passive, active, intra_redirect_to,
   redirection_id, require_version, listen_on_ip). No backword incompatibilites
   introduced though except for the fact that and ``options'' element must be
   present in the configuration file even if it is empty.
 - Added a new feature allowing for second level of redirection, or what I 
   call "Intra-redirection". It allows for previously accepted network 
   connection to be re-redirected to another target.
 - It is now possible to specify a local ip to be bound to a listening socket.
   Which means if you have more than one ip assigned to your host (multi-homed)
   then you can accept incoming redirections targeted at the specifed 
   ip.
 - Simple yet effective config file version lock. Insures that the config file
   is processed with the correct version of the program.
 - Minor structural change to the config file: the ``options'' group should
   appear first in the file. 
 - Updates to documentation.


20 April 2000  -- 0.4 
---------------------
Fixes:
 - Fixed wrong interpretation of network prefix
 
Additions:
 - The configuration script looks for libc_r under FreeBSD if pthread
   was not found.
 - Ability to use IP numbers as well as host names in the config file.
 - It's now possible to use service names and port numbers interchangeably.
   e.g. you could use either "telnet" or "23" as a valid port definition.

---------------

 - Completely reworked configuration file
 - Support for multible redirections
 - Command line  parameters
